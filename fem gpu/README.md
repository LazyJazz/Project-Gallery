# Finite Element Method on GPU

This demo is real-time screen recording without clipping.

Droping a elastic block from distanced height to a plane ground. The visualized vertices and connections are just for convenient demonstration. It's not a mass-spring system.

This simulation is solved with implicit time stepping.
